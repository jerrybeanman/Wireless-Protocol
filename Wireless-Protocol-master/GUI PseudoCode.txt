Program starts on winmain function.
Main dialog handle is constructed and shown.
File opener structure is defined and constructed.
	Structure contains flags limiting the file opener to only .txt files.
	Structure is assigned a parent window, our dialog handle.
	Structure also contains other information, such as general requirement flags.

Winmain begins message listener loop.


Wndproc : Message handler for our program.
	Our window will be constructed with 2 text areas, one for input, one for output data.
	As well as read file from computer button, a send button, priority heirachy checkbox, a recieved file chooser combobox, sending progress bar, statistics area, and a save read file button.
		- Open button:
			This button opens a file opener dialog which allows the user to select a file from their computer by easily browsing through the filesystem. (Upon triggering this button within WndProc, a new thread will be created, constructing the window.)
		- Send Button
			This button will send the loaded information on the left pane of the window (our loaded file), to recieving end.
		- Save Button
			This button will save the text on the right to a new file. This file will be specified by user input through a file opener dialog.
		- Priority Heiarchy Checkbox
			This checkbox will tell the reciever that it is requesting a higher priority over the transmission than the reciever. If they are both requesting higher priority, they will share the line.
	The program's two text files also include the ability to see the sending and recieving files:
		- Input text area
			The input text area will display a blank area, which may be loaded with an existing file via the open button. The user also has the option to click on the field and edit it themselves.
			Finally, the save button will allow the user to save the information currently within this window to a file the choose.
		- Output text area
			This field will allow the user to see a recieved file from their sender. This field will be read-only, and inheritly blank, until a user selected a succesfully downloaded file from the list of received files.
		- Recieved File ComboBox
			This ComboBox will be a list of all recieved files. When a user clicks on the combobox, it will display the loaded file into the output text area window.
	Finally, information about the transmissions will also be displayed:
		- Sending progress bar
			The sending progress bar will display the progress on how much of the current file has been sent, and how much left there is to send.
		- Statistics area
			The statistics area will include several text fields which display information about the transmissions. The information will include:
				- Sent packets
				- Lost packets
				- Recieved Packets
				- Corrupted Packets Recieved
				- Amount of ACK's sent and recieved
				- Amount of NAK's sent and recieved
				- Bit Error Rate
